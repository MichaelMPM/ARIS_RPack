arismpm_atlas2,SHIP,"This Atlas was based on a design which was stolen back from pirates. Modified and refitted into an exploration starship, the original design was captured and modified far from any space dock. A risky manuever by captains, but a necessary one to replace lost ships. This Atlas now serves Exploration and Adventuring fleets.

This Atlas, saved from the vacuum and fire, now delivers a cargo of survey data from the hand of an explorer.",,,,
arismpm_atlas,SHIP,"The Atlas-class ships are large space-borne cargo platforms with an FTL drive and a few defensive systems. Hundreds of containers can be latched on to the hull and carried with ease by this behemoth. This new model of Atlas accompanies Exploration fleets, and provides some refitted advantages over its counterpart. But no worries here, this is still a cargo workhorse.

The captaincy of an Atlas is a rare punishment for the able, an uneven mixture of soul-numbing boredom and abject terror, being the results of normal trade runs and pirate attacks, respectively.",,,,
arismpm_venture,SHIP,"Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually purchased by private corporations for escort duty or refitted by small non-aligned worlds for system defense. Now this Venture serves a new purpose, supporting long-range and exploration fleets. It lacks the default mining drones yet supplements them for long-range surveillance fighters.

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.","Tough and dependable, the Venture is usually fitted with a good missile complement but lacks the sustained damage output needed to do well in prolonged engagements.",,,
